# 🛡️ ShadowHunt+

ShadowHunt+ is a beginner-friendly **phishing website detection tool** built using **Python and Flask**. It analyzes a given URL and its webpage content to determine whether the site is **Safe, Suspicious, or Phishing**.

This project is designed to demonstrate **real-world cybersecurity concepts** in a simple, understandable way, making it ideal for students, beginners, and hackathon demos.

 Features

*  URL structure analysis (length, IP usage, special characters, HTTPS check)
*  Live webpage content inspection
*  Detects password fields and phishing keywords
*  Risk scoring mechanism
*  Clear classification: Safe / Suspicious / Phishing
*  Clean cyber-themed web interface
*  Lightweight and easy to run
